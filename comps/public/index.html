      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

    <!-- What does a portal do? Well, a portal is going to change the way React works.
    Normally we take the HTML produced by our modal component and place it right there.
    A portal is going to tell React to do something a little bit different.
    We're going to tell React, don't place the model's HTML right here as a child of the HTML for the modal page component.
    Instead, we want to take all the HTML produced by the modal component and place it down here at some other location inside of our HTML documents.
    Why does that fix the problem? Well, it's real simple. -->
